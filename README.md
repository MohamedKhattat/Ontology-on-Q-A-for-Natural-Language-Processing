# Ontology-on-Q-A-for-Natural-Language-Processing
Question answering (QA) system aims at retrieving precise information from a large collection of documents against a query. The proposed architecture defines four basic modules suitable for enhancing current QA capabilities with the ability of processing complex questions. The first module was the question processing, which analyses and classifies the question and also reformulates the user query. The second module allows the process of retrieving the relevant ontological relations from the given question. The next module processes the retrieved words from question. Natural language processing techniques are used for processing the question and documents and also for answer extraction. Ontology and domain knowledge are used for reformulating queries and identifying the relations.
